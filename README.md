# policy-eval

policy-eval is a simulation-based framework for evaluating and comparing policies
in systems with human behavior under uncertainty.

## What this is

policy-eval provides a generic engine for running controlled, stochastic
experiments that compare policies by their outcome distributions across
multiple metrics.

The framework separates:
- actors (humans, institutions, systems)
- policies (rules, incentives, constraints)
- metrics (how outcomes are evaluated)

## What this is NOT

- Not a predictive model of the real world
- Not an optimization or policy-recommendation system
- Not an agent framework
- Not tied to any specific domain or dataset

The goal is comparison and insight, not automation or claims of optimality.
